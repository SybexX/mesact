<pcw--home> On the 5ABOB the 7I92 needs pullups for the 5ABOB's isolated inputs to work
<pcw--home> Also the 5ABOBs input work by grounding (they are OPTOs with the LED anodes connected to +12V)
<pcw--home> (the 12V comes from the 5ABOBs on card voltage regulator that supplies the 0 to 10V analog out )
<pcw--home> Did you get the limit switch inputs to work?
<pcw--home> Note that with a parallel port connection, 5V GND = frame GND
<Gothia1> so i am just focussing to fix the emergency stop and then try to use the same solution for both issues
<pcw--home> that may not be the case with a 7I92 (unless the 5V comes from the PC)
<Gothia1> @pcw--home: 
<Gothia1> noted
<pcw--home> Sounds like you may have a missing ground
<Gothia1> yes. i agree
<Gothia1> Electrical ground is connected to the mesa card through the top left hole (by the ethernet connection)
<Gothia1> so i screwed the card to the frame of the cabinet, and tested the voltage differential with the main ground wire
<pcw--home> that is only frame GND for EMI protection
<pcw--home> the 5V common is not grounded unless you ground it somewhere else
<pcw--home> in any case, you must enable pullups on the 7I92T
<Gothia1> the jumpers were connected as pull down in the last try i made
<Gothia1> let me set them up as pull up again
<pcw--home> That can never work because of the way the OPTOs are connected to the DB25 pins (just bare OPTO transistor collectors at least in the 5ABOBs I have seen)

<JT-Cave> pcw--home, is the 7i92T the same for 5abob inputs?
<pcw--home> The 7I92 does not have the option to use pull downs (only the 7I92T)
<pcw--home> Many parallel port BOBs depend on pullups on the parallel port input pins
<JT-Shop> thanks
<pcw--home> (the 7I92 I/O pin always have pullups)
