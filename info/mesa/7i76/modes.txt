The 7I76 has three software selectable process data modes. These different modes
select different sets of 7I76 data to be transferred between the host and the 7I76 during
real time process data exchanges. For high speed applications, choosing the correct mode
can reduce the data transfer sizes, resulting in higher maximum update rates.

MODE 0 I/O only mode (32 bits of input data, 16 bit of output data)

MODE 1 I/O plus analog input mode (32 bits of input data, 16 bits of output data, 4
analog input channels)

MODE 2 I/O plus analog input and field voltage and MPG mode (32 bits of input data,
16 bits of output data, 4 analog input channels, field voltage analog in, and
2 MPG encoders on inputs 16..19). Default encoder count mode is 1X to
match normal 100 PPR MPGs. Encoder input threshold is fixed at 2.5V for
compatibility with 5V encoder outputs.
