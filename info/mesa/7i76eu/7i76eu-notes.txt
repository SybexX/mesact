32 sinking inputs and 16 sourcing, sinking, or push-pull outputs

The 7I76EU (and 7I76U) have 3 new parameters and the 7I84U has 2 new parameters

The main 2 added parameters are 7i76.[port].[chan].output_source and
7i76.[port].[chan].output_sink. or 7i84.[port].[chan].output_source and
7I84.[port].[chan].output_sink. These are 16 bit masks that control the field
output mode. Each xxxx.output_source  bit controls the source attribute of the
corresponding output bit and each xxxx.output_sink bit controls the sink
attribute. The default setting is for all source mode
(xxxx.output_source = 65535 or 0xFFFF, xxxx.output_sink = 0 or 0x0000) which
means a 7I76EU, 7I76U or 7I84U behave like a 7I76E,7I76 or 7I84.

So for example:

xxxx.output_sink = 0 = 0x0000
xxxx.output_source = 65535 =0xFFFF
 = normal all sourcing mode (like 7I76E, 7I76,7I84, this is the default)

xxxx.output_sink = 65536 =0xFFFF
xxxx.output_source = 0 = 0x0000
 =  all sinking mode  (like 7I76ED,7I76D,7I84D)

xxxx.output_sink = 65280 =0xFF00
xxxx.output_source = 255 = 0x00FF
= outputs 0..7 are sourcing mode, outputs 8..15 are sinking mode

xxxx.output_sink = 65535 =0xFFFF
xxxx.output_source = 65535 = 0xFFFF
= all outputs are in push-pull mode

Note that each of the 16 output bits can be individually setup for
sourcing, sinking, or push-pull mode.

The 7I76EU and 7I76U also have a spinmode parameter to set the spindle output
bit mode when this is 0 (default) the isolated spindle output bits are ENA and
DIR as before. If the spindle mode bit is set to 1 , the isolated spindle
output bits now function as FWD and REV.
