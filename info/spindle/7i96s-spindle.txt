To set up really basic operation (ignoring the ini file values and the PID), at the minimum,
you need to setup and connect PWMGen 00:

setp hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.00.scale 24000
setp hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.00.pwm_frequency 5000
setp hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.00.output_type 1

net spindle-vel-cmd-rpm-abs hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.00.value
net spindle-on spindle.0.on
net spindle-on hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.00.enable

You probably also need to connect the signal "spindle-on"
to a 7I96S isolated output:

net spindle-on hm2_7i96s.0.outm.00.out-04
