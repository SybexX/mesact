With bipolar supplies if you want 0 output, the PWM must be 50% of full scale.
This is done by setting the PWM offset mode true:

set hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.00.offset-mode true

Note that you must use an additional output to control spindle enable
because the analog out will start up at full negative speed when linuxCNC
is not running 

You have the PWM frequency set to 20 KHz in your hal file:
setp hm2_5i24.0.pwmgen.pwm_frequency 20000 

<JT-Cave> pcw--home, what does hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.pdm_frequency do?
<pcw--home> JT-Cave: its sets the PDM frequency (if PDM mode is selected)
<JT-Cave> how do you select PDM mode?
<pcw--home> its one of the 4 PWGgen "output types"
<JT-Cave> hm2_7i96s.0.pwmgen.00.output-type
<JT-Cave> hmm I seem to recall that somewhat now
<pcw--home> PDM is easier to filter than PWM so better for high speed analog outputs
<JT-Cave> thanks
<JT-Cave> (s32 rw) output-type
<JT-Cave> This emulates the output_type load-time argument to the software pwmgen component. This parameter may be changed at runtime, but most of the time you probably want to set it at startup and then leave it alone. Accepted values are 1 (PWM on Out0 and Direction on Out1), 2 (Up on Out0 and Down on Out1), 3 (PDM mode, PDM on Out0 and Dir on Out1), and 4 (Direction on Out0 and PWM on Out1, "for locked antiphase").
<JT-Cave> from man hostmot2 page, what is out0 and out1?
<JT-Cave> for a 7i96s
<pcw--home> on a 7I96S's local analog out, only out0 is connected
<pcw--home> I have not tried PDM on the 7I96S analog out, it should work but since its not a high speed output  (~300 Hz bandwidth) its not needed
<JT-Cave> thanks
<JT-Cave> so all the boards that have an isolated potentiometer replacement type device only out0 is connected?
<JT-Cave> for the spindle
<pcw--home> well 7I76/7I76E is different since the analog is done with sserial
<JT-Cave> 7I76/7I76E support all 4 functions of pwmgen output-type?
<pcw--home> no
<pcw--home> no options since its basically fixed purpose (the FPGA outputs need to be more flexible)
<JT-Cave> ah ok
<JT-Cave> should the pwm_frequency just be set at The default pwm_frequency is 20,000 Hz (20 kHz). or is there a reason to set it to some other value?
<pcw--home> For analog servo daughter cards (and the 7I97) there are different recommendations
<JT-Shop> ok
<pcw--home> 7I33 = 6 MHz PDM, 7I48 48 KHz up/down mode,7I36 and 7I97 48 MHz PWM/DIR mode with offset mode selected
<JT-Shop> thanks
