Note, with "sserial_port_0=0xxxxxxx" you have disabled all but one sserial channel
(the expansion channel on the 7I96S is the only enabled channel)

For a 7i96s_7i76d configuration you should enable all sserial ports with "sserial_port_0=ABCxxxxx"

Where ABC are the modes of sserial channels 0,1,2 respectively.
