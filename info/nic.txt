The (X86) tmax values are in CPU clocks so to get the percentage of servo
thread time these represent you must divide them by CPU clocks per full
servo period = servo thread period in seconds*CPU clock speed in Hz
servo period 1000000ns
0.001 = servo thread period in seconds = 1000000 / 1000000000
cpu speed 3300 MHz == 3300000000 Hz
read tmax 1214912
write tmax 264328
packet time 44.8%
